 - Bugs/TODO
   - Verify compatibility with various scheme libraries
   - Try to implement some SRFIs
   - Allow to override built type functions with closures
   - Add a system to control that a type is activated when using it (basically
     the same as ESCM_USE_* macros but in runtime).

 - Features
   - Unicode support (both characters and strings, see r6rs for possible impl)
   - Create a new good number type with rationals, integers, reals and complex.
   - Bignums

 - Maybe:
   - Slashification
   - Continuations
   - Recode Macro implementation
   - Clean bnumber implementation
