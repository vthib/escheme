 - Load "init.scm"
 - Finish all primitives
 - Finish the basic number implementation
 - Finish the Macro implementation
 - Verify compatibility with various scheme libraries
 - Try to implement some SRFIs
 - Manage circular lists in printing
 - Add configurables things in runtime, ie (set-case-sensitive! #t) or
 (set-brackets-parens! #t)

Maybe:

 - Correct the bug with the "do" macro
 - Create a new good number type with rationals, integers, reals and complex.
 - Create a new good number type with integers and reals unboxed.
